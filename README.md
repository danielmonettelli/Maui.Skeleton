# Maui.Skeleton

This nuget package has been created by the team at Horus Studio and, thanks to their generous collaboration, will be kept up-to-date until the project owner adds the corresponding pull request. While I am not the owner of this nuget package, I am deeply grateful to Horus Studio for their effort and dedication in keeping it updated and available for use. I take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude for their valuable contribution.
